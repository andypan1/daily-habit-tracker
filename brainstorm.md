- A travel app where if you pinpoint on a map it will show you top things to do in the nearest popular city.
- A daily habit tracker that could include features such as reminders, streak tracking, and motivational quotes to help users stay consistent with their habits.
- A sports app that gives real-time updates for their favorite sports team to follow.
